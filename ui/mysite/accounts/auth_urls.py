"""
URL patterns for the views included in ``django.contrib.auth``.

Including these URLs (via the ``include()`` directive) will set up the
following patterns based at whatever URL prefix they are included
under:

* User login at ``login/``.

* User logout at ``logout/``.

* The two-step password change at ``password/change/`` and
  ``password/change/done/``.

* The four-step password reset at ``password/reset/``,
  ``password/reset/confirm/``, ``password/reset/complete/`` and
  ``password/reset/done/``.

The default registration backend already has an ``include()`` for
these URLs, so under the default setup it is not necessary to manually
include these views. Other backends may or may not include them;
consult a specific backend's documentation for details.
