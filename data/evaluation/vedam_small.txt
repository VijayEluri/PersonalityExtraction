Swapped the <E>Elantra</E> with a <E>Santa Fe</E> to deal with all that <E>snow</E> on the <E>roads</E>.
<E>No one Killed Jessica</E> is good though melodramatic. <E>Myra</E> is hot!
@dpolice Hard to say. If the user is geeky - <E>Nexus S</E> . Otherwise <E>iPhone 4</E> . :) Both are great phones.
<E>Tron</E> is <E>3D</E> done right. highly recommended if you like <E>scifi</E> stuff.
Today's "Atrocious Tie of the Day" award goes to yours truly.
There's a blogging contest at work. Topics are technical. But the word limit is 400! Too less to write anything substantial! I hate limits:D
@adived is it OK to drive upto <E>liberty state park</E>?
About to embark on the unthinkable... Driving to <E>New York City</E>. Wish me luck.

testing <E>google</E> <E>voice recognition</E>
<E>iTunes</E> / <E>ipod</E> ecosystem needs to learn a thing or two from <E>Doggcatcher</E>. Seriously. This is the best solution for <E>podcast</E> listeners out there.
Is it possible to be perfectly politically correct while cracking a joke or attempting a stab at humor? Humor without offense?
<E>Exchange ActiveSync</E> works beautifully. Setting up the <E>corporate</E> <E>email</E> and <E>calendar</E> was a breeze. With <E>Doggcatcher</E> and <E>Audible</E>, all set!
With <E>3G</E> on all the time, the <E>Nexus S</E> gives me around 20 hours of <E>battery</E> life - moderate calling and <E>web surfing</E>. (Forgot <E>Angry Birds</E>). Wow!
if I find the <E>harry Potter</E> <E>movie</E> boring does it mean I am old?
Why <E>IT industry</E> is ignoring #<E>Gujarat</E> ? Is it because of the <E>prohibition</E> ?
If I buy the hardcover edition of any book on #<E>Amazon</E> , I should get the <E>Kindle</E> edition free. :(
Best part of <E>The Hurt Locker</E> ? The lack of background music! Silence speaks quite loudly in this <E>movie</E>.
<E>Keesaragutta</E> <E>temple</E> : An interesting <E>ecosystem</E> where <E>monkeys</E>, <E>parrots</E>, <E>dogs</E> and <E>humans</E> co-exist in a tightly bonded <E>society</E>.

@PeterGriffinn I thought that was a security feature (not telling which one is incorrect - username or password)
@vjvegi Why this comment about <E>Pakistan</E> all of a sudden? :)
@EmailManual By any chance you have <E>UK</E> specific <E>market</E> <E>data</E> of <E>Android</E> Vs <E>iPhone</E> Vs <E>Blackberry</E> ? Thanks for the link btw.
Thank you for all your resumes! Just one word of advice:When you say "I am writer, ur lookin for 1?" how can one take you seriously? :)

@tilak_reddy Thanks boss :) Life is unpredictable and is better that way.
The day people stop telling others how to live, I believe the world will be a much better place.
