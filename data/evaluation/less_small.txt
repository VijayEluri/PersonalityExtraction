@archjake I thought <E>VAV</E> is only for <E>air systems</E> and not <E>hydronic systems</E>... So, do you think I could generalize and say <E>VAV</E> allow for <E>zones</E> ?
I don't understand how variable <E>air volume systems</E> can have 3 separate and conflicting definitions in <E>Kaplan</E>, <E>Ballast</E>, and <E>MEEB</E> #blah.
